## Hello from Lithuania with UAB Dinecat

UAB Dinecat is a small company founded by Mykola Zyk in early 2012. Since 2012, we have been developing and maintaining
software using Symfony. We work both on our own product and provide outsourcing services.

We support open source software and plan to publish some of our work here.
